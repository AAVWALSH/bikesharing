### Overview of analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis was completed by using a dataset from a bike sharing company active in New York City. The analysis focues on determining how the service was used (length of trip, areas of use)and by what type of user (subscriber or not, gender, age).
This set of visualizations shows:
- The length of time bikes are checked out for all riders. 
- The number of bike trips for all users broken down into time of day per weekday
- THe number of bike trips for each day of the week. 

The visualizations also check what type of user and allows for filtering by gender.

### Summary and ideas for future analysis
Based off the visualizations of the analysis we can determine that the main client base of the service are male subscribers. Also based off the fact that the most common usage times are in the morning and early evening that the bike-sharing service is most often used by commuters and not tourists. The most common rides were short duration quick trips that indicate the future development should have bike depots in proximity to one another as a customer who had to go out of their way to drop off a bike would likely not use the service very frequently. 

For future exploration I would look at not just trip duration but also distance travelled. By mapping the start and stop locations you can see if there are particularly common routes, if certain stations used more than others, and look at local business data to see if there are further patterns that can be found regarding what type of commuters use the service. 
I would also join the presented bike data to local weather data from APIs to see how weather patterns effect bike usage- I would assume rainy or snowy weather would effect bike usage. Also extreme heat as commuters would not want to show up at work sweaty. 
In my opinion the most important step for future analysis would be to project these findings, which are specific to New York City, into actionable intelligence to a Des Moines, Iowa market. What are the comparable factors? Knowing from the above data the primary users of the bike sharing app are male commuters and that the majority of the trips taken are for less than 10 minutes can advise the locations of bike depots around corporate offices and transit hubs. Does Des Moines have a similar commuter culture as New York?
